## Podspec

GEOS is an open source C++ library for working with geospatial geometry. Learn
more on its [homepage](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos). This repo makes its C
interface available through CocoaPods, Carthage, and Swift PM so you can use it
in your Swift or Objective-C project. It is commonly used via
[GEOSwift](https://github.com/GEOSwift/GEOSwift).

## Requirements

* iOS 8.0+, macOS 10.7+, tvOS 9.0+ (CocoaPods, Carthage, Swift PM)
* Linux (Swift PM)

> GEOS is licensed under LGPL 2.1 and its compatibility with static linking is
at least controversial. Use of geos without dynamic linking is discouraged.

## Installing with CocoaPods

1. Update your `Podfile` to include:

        use_frameworks!
        pod 'geos'

2. Run `$ pod install`

## Installing with Carthage

1. Update your `Cartfile` to include:

        github "GEOSwift/geos" ~> 4.1.0

2. Finish updating your project by following the [typical Carthage
workflow](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#quick-start).

## Installing with Swift PM

1. Update the top-level dependencies in your `Package.swift` to include:

        .package(url: "https://github.com/GEOSwift/geos.git", from: "4.1.0")

2. Update the target dependencies in your `Package.swift` to include

        "geos"

## History

Starting with tag 3.7.0 in this repo, the Podspec here should match the one in
the CocoaPods specs repo. This has not always been the case. For example, the
3.5.0 tag in this repo does not actually represent what you get if you install
3.5.0 from CocoaPods. Alas, this situation should be remedied as we move
forward.

Version 3.7.0 is based on the actually-published 3.5.0 podspec.

Through version 3.7.1, the version numbers in this repo were designed to match
the corresponding version numbers in GEOS itself. Starting with version 4.0.0,
we are breaking with this pattern and will instead use semantic versioning on
this build configuration itself rather than trying to match the underlying geos
version. This allows us more flexibilty to improve the build config
independently of the geos release cycle.

## Developing

The most common development activity is updating to a new version of GEOS. To
get started:

1. Install autotools: `$ brew install autoconf automake libtool`
2. Modify `update.sh` to indicate the version of GEOS that you wish to use.
3. Run `update.sh`
4. Debug any issues. The script may need to be modified to work with newer
versions of the library. Please keep it up-to-date so that we have a record of
how to get from the GEOS source to the end result in this repo.
5. Update `geos.podspec`, `geos.xcodeproj`, and `Package.swift` to ensure
continued support for CocoaPods, Carthage, and Swift PM.
6. Test all your changes on the full matrix of supported configs (CocoaPods,
Carthage, Swift PM) x (iOS, macOS, tvOS) + Swift PM x Linux.
7. Update the version numbers in `Resources/Info.plist` and `geos.podspec`
8. Update this README with any relevant information.
